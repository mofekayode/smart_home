# 🎯 What's Working in Cairo - Phase 2

**Date:** October 28, 2025

## ✅ WHAT WORKS

### 1. Home Assistant Connection
- ✅ **Connected to HA API** at http://localhost:8123
- ✅ **Authentication working** with long-lived token
- ✅ **Can read all entities** (60 total discovered)

### 2. Entity Discovery
You have **60 entities** in Home Assistant:

#### 💡 **Lights** (2):
- `light.tall_lamp` - "Tall lamp" (currently on, brightness 103)
  - ⚠️ **Issue**: Last updated Oct 15 - may be offline
- `light.short_lamp` - "short lamp" (currently on, brightness 103)
  - ⚠️ **Issue**: May also be offline

#### 🔌 **Switches** (1):
- `switch.bot1` - "Switch bot" (currently off)
  - Battery: 100%

#### 📊 **Sensors** (32):
**Backup Sensors:**
- backup_backup_manager_state
- backup_next_scheduled_automatic_backup
- backup_last_successful_automatic_backup
- backup_last_attempted_automatic_backup

**Sun/Astronomy Sensors:**
- sun_next_dawn, sun_next_dusk, sun_next_midnight, sun_next_noon
- sun_next_rising, sun_next_setting

**Phone (Mofepi) Sensors:**
- mofepi_battery_state (Not Charging)
- mofepi_battery_level (85%)
- mofepi_storage
- mofepi_ssid (Jollof)
- mofepi_bssid
- mofepi_geocoded_location (265 27th St, Oakland CA 94612)
- mofepi_connection_type
- mofepi_app_version (2025.10.0)
- mofepi_location_permission (Authorized Always)
- mofepi_audio_output
- mofepi_last_update_trigger

**Z-Wave/Device Sensors:**
- z_stick_10_pro_status (ready)
- tall_lamp_node_status (alive)
- short_lamp_node_status (alive)
- bot1_battery (100%)
- motion_sensor_battery (77%)
- motion_sensor_temperature (66.812°F)
- centralite_3310_g_battery (100%)
- centralite_3310_g_temperature (69.152°F)
- centralite_3310_g_humidity (57.51%)

#### 🔄 **Updates** (5)
#### 🔘 **Buttons** (4)
#### 🤖 **Automations** (4)
#### ⚡ **Events** (3)
#### 👤 **Binary Sensors** (2)
#### 💬 **Conversation** (1)
#### 📍 **Zone** (1)
#### 👤 **Person** (1)

### 3. Cairo Services Built

#### ✅ **EventBus Service** (services/event-bus/)
- **Status**: ✅ Working perfectly
- Publishes/subscribes to events via Redis Streams
- Tested with wake_word.detected events
- All type definitions complete

#### ✅ **Tools Service** (services/tools/)
- **Status**: ✅ Built and tested
- Can read HA entity states
- Can call HA services
- MCP-style tool definitions:
  - `ha.read_state` (safety: read)
  - `ha.call_service` (safety: write_safe)
- ToolRegistry integrated with EventBus

### 4. API Capabilities

#### ✅ **Reading Data** - WORKS PERFECTLY
```typescript
// Read any entity state
await ha.getState('light.tall_lamp');
await ha.getState('sensor.motion_sensor_temperature');

// List all entities
await ha.listEntities(); // Returns 60 entities
```

#### ⚠️ **Controlling Devices** - PARTIALLY WORKING
```typescript
// Command is sent successfully
await ha.callService('light', 'turn_off', {
  entity_id: 'light.tall_lamp'
});
// Returns: [] (HA accepts command)

// BUT: Physical devices may not respond
// Reason: Devices might be offline/unreachable
```

**Service calls return `[]` (empty array)** which means:
- ✅ HA API accepts the command
- ✅ No errors returned
- ⚠️ Physical devices don't respond (likely offline)

## ❌ WHAT DOESN'T WORK YET

### 1. Physical Device Control
- **Lights** appear to be offline (last updated Oct 15)
- **Switch bot** might work but needs testing
- Need to check if Z-Wave/Zigbee devices are actually reachable

### 2. End-to-End Voice Control
- ❌ No voice pipeline yet (Phase 3)
- ❌ No conversation manager yet (Phase 4)
- ❌ Can't say "Cairo, turn on lights" yet

### 3. Event-Driven Tool Execution
- ✅ Tools service can execute tools
- ✅ ToolRegistry listens for `tool.request` events
- ❌ No service publishing `tool.request` events yet
- Need conversation manager to trigger tools

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Option A: Fix Device Connectivity
1. Check if Z-Wave/Zigbee devices are actually online in HA
2. Test with a device that's confirmed working
3. Maybe try the switch.bot1 (battery at 100%, might be responsive)

### Option B: Continue Building
Since reading data works perfectly, we can proceed with:
1. **Phase 3**: Voice pipeline (wake word, ASR, TTS)
2. **Phase 4**: Conversation manager (to trigger tools)
3. Come back to physical device control when HA devices are online

## 🎯 BOTTOM LINE

### What Cairo Can Do RIGHT NOW:
1. ✅ Read ALL your Home Assistant data
2. ✅ See 60 entities (sensors, lights, switches, etc.)
3. ✅ Send commands to Home Assistant API
4. ✅ Event-driven architecture working
5. ✅ Tool system ready for LLM integration

### What Cairo CAN'T Do Yet:
1. ❌ Voice control (no voice pipeline)
2. ❌ Understand commands (no conversation manager)
3. ❌ Control physical devices (they appear offline)

### Recommendation:
**Continue building!** The infrastructure is solid. Physical device issues are likely a Home Assistant/network problem, not a Cairo problem. You can fix device connectivity later while continuing to build the voice and conversation layers.

Next phase: Voice Pipeline 🎤
