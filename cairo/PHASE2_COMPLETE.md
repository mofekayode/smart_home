# ✅ Phase 2 Complete: Home Assistant Integration

**Date Completed:** October 28, 2025

## What Was Built

### 1. Tools Service (TypeScript)
- ✅ Initialized npm project in `services/tools/`
- ✅ Installed dependencies: axios, ioredis, uuid, dotenv, typescript, tsx
- ✅ Configured TypeScript for ESM modules
- ✅ Created service directory structure

### 2. Home Assistant Client
- ✅ Created `HomeAssistantClient` class (services/tools/src/ha_client.ts)
- ✅ Axios-based HTTP client with bearer token authentication
- ✅ Implemented methods:
  - `checkConnection()` - Verify HA API is accessible
  - `getState(entityId)` - Read entity state
  - `callService(domain, service, data)` - Control devices
  - `listEntities()` - Get all entities
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for EntityState

### 3. MCP-Style Tool Definitions
- ✅ Created tool type system (services/tools/src/types.ts):
  - `MCPTool` interface with name, description, schemas, execute function
  - `JSONSchema` type for input/output validation
  - Safety levels: `read`, `write_safe`, `write_risky`

### 4. Home Assistant Tools
- ✅ **ha.read_state** (services/tools/src/tools/ha_read_state.ts)
  - Safety level: `read`
  - Reads current state of any HA entity
  - Input: entity_id
  - Output: state, attributes, last_changed

- ✅ **ha.call_service** (services/tools/src/tools/ha_call_service.ts)
  - Safety level: `write_safe`
  - Controls HA devices via service calls
  - Input: domain, service, data (entity_id, brightness, color, temp, etc.)
  - Output: success, domain, service, entity_id
  - Supports: light, switch, lock, climate, cover, media_player, fan, scene

### 5. Tool Registry
- ✅ Created `ToolRegistry` class (services/tools/src/registry.ts)
- ✅ Maintains Map of available tools
- ✅ Subscribes to `tool.request` events from EventBus
- ✅ Executes tools and publishes `tool.result` or `tool.error` events
- ✅ Methods: `registerTool()`, `getTool()`, `getAllTools()`, `listTools()`

### 6. Main Service Entry Point
- ✅ Created main.ts (services/tools/src/main.ts)
- ✅ Connects to Redis EventBus
- ✅ Connects to Home Assistant
- ✅ Registers all tools
- ✅ Starts listening for tool.request events

### 7. Testing
- ✅ Created comprehensive test script (services/tools/src/test.ts)
- ✅ Tests HA connection
- ✅ Lists all entities
- ✅ Shows entities by domain
- ✅ Reads sample light and switch states
- ✅ All tests passing!

## Test Results

### HA Integration Test
```
🧪 Testing Home Assistant Integration

1️⃣  Testing connection...
   ✅ Connected: true

2️⃣  Listing entities...
   ✅ Found 60 entities

   📊 Entities by domain:
      sensor: 32
      update: 5
      button: 4
      automation: 4
      event: 3
      light: 2
      binary_sensor: 2
      conversation: 1
      zone: 1
      person: 1

3️⃣  Sample lights:
   💡 light.tall_lamp: on
      "Tall lamp "
   💡 light.short_lamp: on
      "short lamp "

4️⃣  Reading detailed state of light.tall_lamp...
   State: on
   Brightness: 103
   Last changed: 2025-10-15T12:10:25.766342+00:00

5️⃣  Sample switches:
   🔌 switch.bot1: off
      "Switch bot"

✅ Home Assistant integration test complete!
```

## Validation Checklist

- ✅ Can connect to Home Assistant API
- ✅ Can list all HA entities
- ✅ Can read device states
- ✅ Tool definitions follow MCP format
- ✅ ToolRegistry subscribes to event bus
- ✅ Tools can be executed via events
- ✅ All TypeScript compiles without errors

## Architecture Achievement

**Event-Driven Tool Execution:**
```
Conversation Service                     Tools Service
       |                                       |
       |--publish(tool.request)--------------->|
       |    {tool: "ha.read_state",            |
       |     args: {entity_id: "light.x"}}     |
       |                                       |
       |                                  [ToolRegistry]
       |                                       |
       |                                  [Execute Tool]
       |                                       |
       |                                   [HA API]
       |                                       |
       |<--publish(tool.result)----------------|
       |    {result: {state: "on"}}            |
```

## Next Steps: Phase 3+

Ready to proceed with:
1. **Voice Pipeline** (Phase 3) - Wake word, VAD, ASR, TTS
2. **Conversation Manager** (Phase 4) - LLM routing and context management
3. **End-to-end voice control** - "Cairo, turn on the lights" → actual light control!

---

**Phase 2 Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Key Achievement:** Cairo can now communicate with Home Assistant via event-driven MCP-style tools!
